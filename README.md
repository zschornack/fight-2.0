# Fight 2.0

This simple browser-based game holds a special place in my heart. I created it back in 2023, before starting university, and it was my biggest project at the time. I built everything from scratch, without any help from AI or advanced tools. Just pure determination and many late nights. While it may seem silly now, I’m proud of what I accomplished and the milestone it represents in my coding journey. Fight 2.0 will always be in this repository as a reminder of how far I’ve come. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it.

*Obs: Fight 1.0 otherwise is so trash no one will ever see.*
